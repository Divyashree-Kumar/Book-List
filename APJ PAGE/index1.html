        <p> Wings of Fire is the deeply inspiring autobiography of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, one of India’s most respected scientists and former President. The book traces his life from his modest upbringing in the coastal town of Rameswaram, where he learned values of discipline, faith, and hard work, to his rise as a leading figure in India’s space and missile development programs. It vividly describes his journey through education, his early career at ISRO, and his crucial role in projects like the SLV-3 and the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). Alongside scientific achievements, Kalam shares personal stories, challenges, and the teamwork behind India’s technological progress. The book motivates readers by showing how dedication, optimism, and learning from failures can lead to remarkable success.
